## Another Sublime Attempt

Keeping Sublime Text 3 settings in git as described by
https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/syncing

My previous attempt worked pretty well for ST2:
https://github.com/bronson/SublimeTextSettings

### Installation

#### Mac/Linux

* Install Sublime Text 3 the usual way: http://www.sublimetext.com/3
* `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/`
* `git clone https://github.com/bronson/Sublime-3-Settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/`
* Install Package Control: https://sublime.wbond.net/installation

Done!  You probably don't even have to restart Sublime.
